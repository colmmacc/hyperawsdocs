# Incident list<a name="tracking-list"></a>

The **Incident list** page contains three sections\. **Open incidents**, **Resolved incidents**, and **Analyses**\. You can manually track new incidents and create analyses from this page\. To learn more about manually tracking an incident, see [Manual creation of incidents](incident-creation.md#incident-tracking-manual) in the *Incident creation* section of this guide\. To learn about post incident analysis, see the [Post\-incident analysis](analysis.md) section of this guide\. 

The **Incident details** displays **Open incidents** in tiles with the title, impact, duration, and chat channel\. After you resolve an incident, it moves to the **Resolved incidents** list\. **Analyses** are in the second tab under **Open incidents**\.
